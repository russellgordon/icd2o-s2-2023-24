### Thread 4, Day 7 - Saturday, May 4, 2024
#### Agenda
1. Culminating Task: [[Tasks/App Development Partnership (S2)\|App Development Partnership]]
	- This is your third working period to implement the plans you have made with your partner(s) at Lakefield DPS.
	- Here are some additional videos Mr. Gordon has recorded to demonstrate a variety of ideas:
		- [How to Move Screens from One Thunkable Project to Another](https://youtu.be/k_2rvjraCOg)
		- [Custom Fonts, Sharing Scores Between Screens, and Backgrounds](https://youtu.be/cLYWhW1gf48)
		- [Randomly Selecting Animations to Show, Sound Effects, and Images](https://youtu.be/ANLsQiKhLy4)
		- [How to Handle Sprite Sheets](https://youtu.be/UlAJwtdxPqY)
			- Sometimes many tiny image assets come embedded in a single large image file. This video explains how to easily "slice up" a sprite sheet into many smaller individual image files in seconds.
			- Also learn how to quickly crop unwanted pixels to create a transparent background using Preview.
	- Here are a couple of examples of using the Canvas component with stages and sprites.
		- Mr. Gordon is available to explain more about how these projects work to anyone who is interested:
			- [Cloning Sprites](https://x.thunkable.com/copy/a9424f26e2a2e56948825d321a1880f1) (gems, trinkets)
			- [Chicken Run](https://x.thunkable.com/copy/48fea4823118359ab377b91cf20b91dc) (a small game)
	- Here are several more sites with useful assets:
		- [Custom TTF Fonts](https://www.fontspace.com/category/ttf)
		- [Pixabay - Royalty Free Sound Effects](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/)
		- [GameArtGuppy](https://www.gameartguppy.com/shop/)
			- This is the source of the [fruit and food images](https://www.gameartguppy.com/shop/food-icons/)! ðŸ˜Ž
		- [The Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com)
			- Many retro video game assets.
	- Here are sites useful for slicing up sprite sheets (see video above on this topic):
		- [EZGif Sprite Sheet Cutter](https://ezgif.com/sprite-cutter)
			- This is useful when you know the size of individual frames.
			- For example, 32x32 pixels or 16x16.
		- [Tools3ox Sprite Sheet Cutter](https://www.tools3ox.com/tools/images/ssc/)
			- This site has an "automatic mode" for slicing up sprite sheets where each frame has a slightly different size.

> [!TIP]
> 
> This is not a must-do, but many websites sharing image assets are heavily littered with intrusive ads (and probably data trackers, too).
> 
> Consider installing an alternative browser that blocks ads and trackers by default; [Vivaldi is one option](https://vivaldi.com/download/) Mr. Gordon has been using lately. It uses the same rendering engine as Chrome (so it will work with all the same sites) but it is *much* nicer to browse the web without intrusive ads.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Make progress on implementation of your app idea.
	- Be certain to briefly share an update [on Notion](https://notion.so), including screenshot(s) and a link to the current state of your project (if using Thunkable) or the **.a3p** file (if using Alice).
