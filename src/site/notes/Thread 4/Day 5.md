### Thread 4, Day 5 - Tuesday, April 30, 2024
#### Agenda
1. Culminating Task: [[Tasks/App Development Partnership (S1)\|App Development Partnership]]
	- This is your first working period to begin implementing  the plans you have made with your partner(s) at Lakefield DPS.
	- You are welcome to use Alice, [Thunkable](https://thunkable.com), [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), [Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu), or whatever programming environment you are comfortable with and that best fits the task at hand.
	- For any students using Thunkable, Mr. Gordon will demonstrate how to load [many images](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/icd2o/Food_Images.zip) at once into a project.
	- Here is a video Mr. Gordon recorded to explain how to program core game play for most types of apps that students are working on:
		- [Math Quiz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFmUKV2IcPM)
		> [!NOTE]
		> More mini-videos like this are coming soon. Categories to be covered are:
		> - Multiple Choice
		> - Vocabulary Quiz
	- Here are some good sources for image and audio assets:

		- [itch.io](https://itch.io/game-assets/free/tag-2d)
		> [!IMPORTANT]
		> 
		> Please keep track of the source(s) from where you obtain image and audio assets for your game. These should be cited within your game – for example – on a "Credits" screen.

###### Things to do before our next class
