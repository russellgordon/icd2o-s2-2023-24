### Thread 4, Day 2 - Tuesday, April 23, 2024
#### Agenda
1. Culminating Task: [[Tasks/App Development Partnership (S2)\|App Development Partnership]]
	- Today, we visit Lakefield District Public School for the first time, to meet our partners and [learn more about them and their interests](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/icd2o/ICD2O_-_App_Development_Partnership_%E2%80%93_Visit_1.pdf).
	- This will help each of you, as the consultants, determine what type of fun, educational app you might design for the students at LDPS, who are your clients.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Please post photos of the [notes you took today](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/icd2o/ICD2O_-_App_Development_Partnership_%E2%80%93_Visit_1.pdf) to [Notion](https://notion.so).
	- Add anything else to your post that helps you remember what the students you spoke with are interested in.
