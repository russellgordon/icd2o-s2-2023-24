### Thread 4, Day 8 - Tuesday, May 7, 2024
#### Agenda
1. Culminating Task: [[Tasks/App Development Partnership (S2)\|App Development Partnership]]
	- Today, we make our third visit to Lakefield District Public School, to collect feedback on software prototypes, or minimum viable products.
	- While we are there, LDPS students will [think aloud as they try out your software prototypes](https://www.youtube.com/embed/0YL0xoSmyZI). 
	- Be sure to [take notes on the feedback given](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/icd2o/ICD2O_-_App_Development_Partnership_%E2%80%93_Visit_3.pdf) and work to manage the expectations of your LDPS partners, if needed.

		
###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Make progress on implementation of your app idea.
	- On [Notion](https://notion.so), share screenshot(s) and a link to the current state of your project (if using Thunkable) or the **.a3p** file (if using Alice).
	- Please also share photos of the notes you took today and add any additional thoughts you have about what to do next based on your conversation at LDPS.
