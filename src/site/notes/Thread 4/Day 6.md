#### Agenda
1. Culminating Task: [[Tasks/App Development Partnership (S2)\|App Development Partnership]]
	- This is your second working period to implement the plans you have made with your partner(s) at Lakefield DPS.
	- Here are videos Mr. Gordon has recorded to explain how to program core game play for most types of apps that students are working on:
		- [Math Quiz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFmUKV2IcPM)
		- [Multiple Choice](https://youtu.be/sUo-4wQzXSc)
		- [Vocabulary Quiz](https://youtu.be/etDWMpTUATk)
	- Students working on apps involving time may find these sites useful:
		- [Customizable Clock Faces](https://www.blocklayer.com/clock-face)
		> [!NOTE]
		> If your app does involve telling time, please speak with Mr. Gordon, who can give you a few tips about how to handle quizzing with time relatively easily.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Make progress on implementation of your app idea.
	- Be certain to briefly share an update [on Notion](https://notion.so), including screenshot(s) and a link to the current state of your project (if using Thunkable) or the **.a3p** file (if using Alice).
