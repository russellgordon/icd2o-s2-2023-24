### Thread 1, Day 8 - Friday, September 29, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Task: [[Tasks/T-Shirt Shadow Prints\|T-Shirt Shadow Prints]]
	- A working period to make progress on this task.
#### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] If you will *not* be on the OE overnight early next week, finish your code and do a [[Tasks/T-Shirt Shadow Prints#Reflection prompts\|"final entry" on Notion]] by 10 PM on Monday evening. This will give Mr. Gordon time to make your transparency on Tuesday morning before our class, when you will make your T-shirt.
- [ ] If you *are* on the overnight, be sure your [[Tasks/T-Shirt Shadow Prints#Reflection prompts\|code is completed and handed in]] by Tuesday evening at 10 PM, so that Mr. Gordon has time to create a transparency of your drawing before Wednedsay, when you will make your T-shirt.
