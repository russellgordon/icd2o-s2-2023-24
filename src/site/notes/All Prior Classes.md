### Thread 1, Day 1 - Tuesday, September 12, 2023
#### Agenda
1. LCAT
	- Please complete your [daily LCAT check](https://lcat.lcs.on.ca) prior to coming to class.
2. Tying Shoelaces Exercise
	- Takeaways:
		- Computers take instructions literally. Very literally.
		- There are two kinds of errors, *syntax- and *logical*.
			- A syntax error is when the computer does not understand an instruction.
			- A logical error is when the computer understands and carries out an instruction, but the result is not what the programmer intended.
