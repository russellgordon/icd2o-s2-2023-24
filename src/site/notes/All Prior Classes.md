	  > [!EXAMPLE]
	  > Mr. Gordon loves baseball, so he might use a green rectangle to represent grass, a blue rectangle to represent the sky, and a baseball flying through the air, with his name in the foreground in bubble letters.
	  > 
	  > Here is one example of bubble letters that Mr. Gordon made last year:
