### Thread 1, Day 4 - Friday, September 22, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Portfolio: Share Evidence Regularly
	- *Process* is as important as *product*.
	- If you did not add an entry after yesterday's class, please do so before continuing today.
2. Task: [[Tasks/Name Plate\|Name Plate]]
	- Today, once you finish the initial task (be sure to carefully review the [[Tasks/Name Plate#Success criteria\|success criteria]]), look for ways to extend your name plate.
	- Add shapes, color, or drawings that are personally meaningful to you â€“ another way to show your understanding is to try doing bubble letters.
	  > [!EXAMPLE]
	  > Mr. Gordon loves baseball, so he might use a green rectangle to represent grass, a blue rectangle to represent the sky, and a baseball flying through the air, with his name in the foreground in bubble letters.
	  > 
	  > Here is one example of bubble letters that Mr. Gordon made last year:
	  > ![Screenshot 2023-09-22 at 1.05.59 PM.png](/img/user/Media/Screenshot%202023-09-22%20at%201.05.59%20PM.png)
