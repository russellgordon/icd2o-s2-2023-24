### Thread 3, Day 7 - Thursday, February 15, 2024
#### Agenda
1. Task: [[Tasks/Authoring Class-Level Procedures\|Authoring Class-Level Procedures]]
	- Together, we will think of [at least 20 useful actions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4RTPdkINbwOknkLEYOYhc0A2j7c9NwPH0AqRuzp_WEnZq1w/viewform), for any combination of these classes in Alice:
		- **Biped**
		- **Flyer**
		- **Prop**
		- **Quadruped**
		- **Slitherer**
		- **Swimmer**
		- **Transport**
		> [!NOTE]
		> 
		> Each student must [submit at least two ideas](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4RTPdkINbwOknkLEYOYhc0A2j7c9NwPH0AqRuzp_WEnZq1w/viewform), without repeats.
		> 
		> The list of submitted actions will be on the TV screen at the front of the class.
	- Then, students will decide upon what actions they want to program for their [[Tasks/Authoring Class-Level Procedures\|mid-module task]].
	> [!TIP]
	> 
	> The procedures you implement *do not* have to be one of the procedure ideas you came up with and submitted to the form.
	- You have the rest of the period to make further progress with your [[Tasks/Authoring Class-Level Procedures\|mid-module task]].
	- Your goal should be to complete at *least* one procedure by our next class.
	> [!NOTE]
	> Here is [the list of procedures and what each student has agreed to work on](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uw5e0pxyFXWhOGLDuGzqFVNYreRS9tJFlQb3ihwxEH4/edit?resourcekey#gid=386892402).

###### Things to do before our next class

- [ ] Make clear progress on your [[Tasks/Authoring Class-Level Procedures\|mid-module task]] by completing at least one procedure and documenting it in a post [on Notion](https://notion.so).
