#### Agenda
1. Activity: [[Activities/Computer Security with Hacktivate\|Computer Security with Hacktivate]]
	- By popular demand, a complete class dedicated to Hacktivate. ðŸš€

> You may find the tutorials at [Regex Crossword](https://regexcrossword.com) useful for developing your skills with searching through text.
> 
> [Terminal Temple](https://www.terminaltemple.com) is a great place to try out Terminal commands (it's not wise to experiment in the Terminal on your own computer).
