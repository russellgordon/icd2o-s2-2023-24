# Reviewing Replies and Making Improvements

## Iterative improvement

Recall the steps of the design process, as first described in our course outline:

![Pasted image 20230917200022.png|500](/img/user/Media/Pasted%20image%2020230917200022.png)

While a portfolio post itself is not a product, a post can be assessed.

Sometimes assessment will be performed by Mr. Gordon – sometimes by yourself – and sometimes by your peers.

As a result of an assessment, feedback is provided.

When you act on feedback to improve the quality of a post, your portfolio improves, and you are demonstrating a better overall understanding of course learning goals.

## Finding feedback

When you visit Notion after Mr. Gordon has made comments on your post, you will see something like this:

If you click on **Updates**, you'll see a summary of the comments made:

## Acting on feedback

For example, the second comment given above suggests that the author (the fictitious student, Walter Gordon) could improve their portfolio post by adding an example. 

Walter can go straight to the post in question by clicking on it's title:

Any text highlighted in yellow contains a comment – when highlighted text is clicked, the comment is shown:

![Screenshot 2023-09-17 at 8.16.52 PM.png](/img/user/Media/Screenshot%202023-09-17%20at%208.16.52%20PM.png)

Here you can see that Walter has added an example, as suggested:

![Screenshot 2023-09-17 at 8.33.43 PM.png](/img/user/Media/Screenshot%202023-09-17%20at%208.33.43%20PM.png)

## Replying to feedback

After acting on feedback, you may be tempted to mark the comment made by Mr. Gordon as "resolved":

![Screenshot 2023-09-17 at 8.35.56 PM.png](/img/user/Media/Screenshot%202023-09-17%20at%208.35.56%20PM.png)

==Please don't resolve comments.==

Instead, make a short reply to indicate that you've acted on the feedback:

![Screenshot 2023-09-17 at 8.36.37 PM.png](/img/user/Media/Screenshot%202023-09-17%20at%208.36.37%20PM.png)

Replies are more helpful than resolving a comment for two reasons:

1. The record of the feedback given *and* your action on that feedback is retained. This is helpful evidence of your effort when we meet later on in a module to discuss your progress and current grade in the course.
2. Mr. Gordon sees a notification and receives an email when students reply to comments. This makes it easier on his end to see the improvement(s) you've made:
