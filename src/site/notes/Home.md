#### Agenda

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Make a [brief portfolio post on Notion](https://notion.so).
	- How did it feel to deliver your app to your partners?
	- What did you learn from the experience?
	- How was this culminating task different for you from other assignments you've had to complete for school?
