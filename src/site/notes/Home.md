### Thread 2, Day 10 - Friday, December 8, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Discussion: [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)
	- Solving logical errors and syntax errors can be frustrating, but everyone deals with it, even experienced programmers.
	- Pairing with a friend to describe what you are trying to do with your code, line by line, can be helpful.
		- Often during this process, you will realize the source of the problem you are having.
	- When a friend is not nearby, [use your duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)! ðŸ¦†
2. Activity: [[Activities/The Replacements Gig Poster - Applying Abstraction\|The Replacements Gig Poster - Applying Abstraction]]
	- Learn how to identify repeated elements in a drawing and then apply abstraction by authoring a function. ðŸš€
	> [!TODO]
	> 
	> As you complete the activity, take note of new vocabulary that is introduced.
	> 
	> Describe your understanding of these new terms in the Notion post that you make for today's class.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Make a portfolio post [on Notion](https://notion.so), share your progress, and summarize what you've learned today about the process of abstraction.
