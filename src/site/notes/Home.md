### Thread 4, Day 5 - Tuesday, April 30, 2024
#### Agenda
1. Culminating Task: [[Tasks/App Development Partnership (S1)\|App Development Partnership]]
	- This is your first working period to begin implementing  the plans you have made with your partner(s) at Lakefield DPS.
	- You are welcome to use Alice, [Thunkable](https://thunkable.com), [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), [Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu), or whatever programming environment you are comfortable with and that best fits the task at hand.
	- For any students using Thunkable, Mr. Gordon will demonstrate how to load [many images](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/icd2o/Food_Images.zip) at once into a project.
	- Here is a video Mr. Gordon recorded to explain how to program core game play for most types of apps that students are working on:
		- [Math Quiz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFmUKV2IcPM)
		> [!NOTE]
		> More mini-videos like this are coming soon. Categories to be covered are:
		> - Telling Time
		> - Multiple Choice
		> - Vocabulary Quiz
	- Here are some good sources for image and audio assets:
		- [Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl)
		- [itch.io](https://itch.io/game-assets/free/tag-2d)
	- Mr. Gordon will now work with students who are building vocabulary quiz games to help them get started.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> Please keep track of the source(s) from where you obtain image and audio assets for your game. These should be cited within your game – for example – on a "Credits" screen.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Make progress on implementation of your app idea.
	- Be certain to briefly share an update [on Notion](https://notion.so), including screenshot(s) and a link to the current state of your project (if using Thunkable) or the **.a3p** file (if using Alice).
