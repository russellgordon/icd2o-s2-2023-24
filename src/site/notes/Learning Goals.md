# Learning Goals

For all learning goals below, we will engage in further discussion.

When you post in [Notion](https://notion.so), decide upon the *one* learning goal you feel is best supported by the evidence you are including in that post. 

Tag the post with that learning goal.

Over time, you will accumulate enough evidence in your portfolio to support the assertion that you have met and perhaps exceeded expectations for the learning goal in question.
