# Gig Poster

## Objective
Loosely follow the [style of Swiss modernism as illustrated by Mike Joyce's work](https://www.swissted.com) and create your own custom gig poster for an [actual concert that has occured in the past](https://www.concertarchives.org) for a given band or musical artist that you like.

## What you'll need to begin
- [ ] The [[Setup/Installing Playgrounds\|Playgrounds app]] installed on your computer
- [ ] Another copy of the [[Setup/Subscribe to Turtle Sketches\|Sketches Template added to your list of playgrounds]], renamed to be titled *Custom Gig Poster*
- [ ] Your black, hardcover, graph paper notebook
- [ ] Writing instruments, including a ruler or straight edge

## Success criteria
- [ ] a hand-drawn plan is made using either a:
	- storyboard approach
		- e.g.: you illustrate, step by step, what parts of the poster you will draw in what order
	 - sketch of entire poster
		 - e.g.: you analyse your sketch and:
			 - [ ] number key elements in the order they will be drawn (sequence)
			 - [ ] identify numerical patterns in the position of elements (where iteration might be used)
			 - [ ] identify similar visual elements in your poster (where abstraction using functions might be used)
	
> [!NOTE]
> Your plan *must* be [shared on Notion](https://notion.so) and approved by Mr. Gordon prior to starting to write code. 

 - to ==meet== expectations, your code should:
	- [ ] show an understanding of *sequence* by producing output that matches your plan
	- [ ] show an understanding of *iteration* by using loops to draw repeated elements

- to ==exceed== expectations, your code should:
	- [ ] show an understanding of *abstraction* by making use of functions that include parameters
	- [ ] show an understanding of *selection* by making use of `if` statements

- [ ] use [color combinations that are appealing](https://www.canva.com/learn/100-color-combinations/#organic-color-inspiration)

> [!NOTE]
> You may use the eyedropper tool to sample [colors from the examples shown](https://www.canva.com/learn/100-color-combinations/#organic-color-inspiration).

- [ ] code should include [[Style/Well Formatted Code#Use Comments to Describe Intent\|concise comments that describe intent]]
- [ ] code is [[Style/Well Formatted Code#Indent Code Consistently\|correctly indented]]
- [ ] Playground is regularly backed up [[Media/Duplicating a Sketch in Playgrounds\|by making duplicates]], using filenames like:
	- `Custom Gig Poster`
	- `Custom Gig Poster v2`
	- `Custom Gig Poster v3`
	- *`et cetera`*

> [!NOTE]
> Create a [[Media/Showing That Regular Backups Were Made\|short screen recording like this one]] to show that your poster was backed up regularly, then [share it on Notion](https://notion.so). Note how seven versions of the playgrounds were made across an hour – a new version made after each significant bit of progress. **You must show the backups made using the list view in Finder.**

- [ ] poster must be for an [actual concert that occurred in the past](https://www.concertarchives.org)


## Exemplar

### Plan

Any of the plans shared for lessons in this module would be suitable:

- [[Media/Blur Poster\|Blur]]
	- Good example identifying sequence (order to draw things in)
	- How to use iteration (analysis to determine where loop)
- [[Media/Replacements Poster\|Replacements]]
	- Identifies sequence
	- Analyses where functions might be used
	- Details on how to draw parts of design shown
- [[Media/Refused Poster\|Refused]]
	- Good detail anlaysing how two loops can be used to draw pattern

### Process

You *must* post about your progress at multiple points while you write your code.

Here is an example from last year:

> [!NOTE]
> Last year students used slightly different portfolio software.

In your portfolio entries, share screenshot(s) of your current work in the **Progress section**.

In the **Learning** section, briefly summarize key achievements using subject-specific vocabulary.

In the **Questions** section, ask about anything that you need a hand with, and Mr. Gordon will reply or be ready to answer your question in the next class.

## Handing in your work

Please [submit your playground to this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYEG6oLgAFN9DR16LC10Hkie5T75342qqwgCTxrKWbZ-GYLA/viewform) using drag and drop. You are encouraged to submit multiple copies of your playground as you are likely to make improvements over time based on feedback received from peers and your teacher.
> [!Tip]
> Remember, you must use the Safari web browser when submitting a playground for drag and drop to work.

## Learning goals
Successful completion of this task is great evidence of mastery for learning goals 4, 5, and 6.
