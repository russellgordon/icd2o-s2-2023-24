# T-Shirt Shadow Prints
## Objective

Create a design that when inverted, will look appealing when [printed with sunlight-activated dye on a T-shirt](https://www.instructables.com/How-Not-to-Create-Lumi-Inkodye-Tee-Shirts/).
## What you'll need to begin

- [ ] The [[Setup/Installing Playgrounds\|Playgrounds app]] installed on your computer
- [ ] Another copy of the [[Setup/Subscribe to Turtle Sketches\|Sketches Template added to your list of playgrounds]], renamed to be titled *T-Shirt Shadow Print*
- [ ] Your black, hardcover, graph paper notebook
- [ ] Writing instruments, including a ruler or straight edge
- [ ] An image to reproduce; possibilities include:
	- [famous landmarks line art](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=famous+landmarks+line+art)
	- [cityscapes line art](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=line+art+cityscapes)
	- [geometric animal art](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=geometric+animal+line+art)
	- [line art to create a sense of perspective](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=line+art+perspective)
	- [optical illusion art](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=optical+illusion+art+using+straight+lines)
## Success criteria

*I know I've been highly successful when...*

- [ ] I made a hand-drawn plan, including a scale, some notes about how to get started, and have identified where there are repeated patterns (to use loops and functions with).
- [ ] I could apply order of statements, loops, and functions to write compact code whereever possible.
- [ ] I wrote [[Style/Well Formatted Code\|human-readable]] code.
- [ ] I created a product over several days or classes, acting on feedback received from peers and my teacher.
- [ ] I made regular backups of my code by making duplicates of my playground file.
- [ ] I shared my progress regularly in my portfolio on [Notion](https://notion.so) and tagged entries [[Learning Goals\|by learning goal]]. 
## Exemplar – Plan

> [!NOTE]
> This is largely a good plan, but it does not have any notes about where functions or loops might be applied. The student might have added windows the silhouette of this image, and used loops and a function to draw those windows.
## Reflection prompts

When you have finished the code for this task, please complete the **Coding Task – Final Entry** template, and be sure to respond to these prompts...

![Screenshot 2023-09-25 at 9.03.41 PM.png|250](/img/user/Media/Screenshot%202023-09-25%20at%209.03.41%20PM.png)

1. Where in your code did you make use of loops? What parts of your drawing did those loops help to make?
2. What were some of the most common syntax errors you ran into? How did you resolve them?
3. It is normal for a program's final output to sometimes vary from the original plan. Was that true in your case? If so, in what ways?

## Due date

In order to return completed T-shirts to you before the Thanksgiving Long Weekend, we will need to be transferring prints on the following dates in each section of this course:

### Section 1

- Monday October 2
- Tuesday October 3

> [!IMPORTANT]
> That means ideally half of our class has completed their [[Tasks/T-Shirt Shadow Prints#Reflection prompts\|final portfolio entry for the task]] by Sunday October 1 at 10 PM, so that Mr. Gordon has time to create transparencies of your images so you can make your shirts.

### Section 2

- Tuesday October 3
- Wednesday October 4

> [!IMPORTANT]
> That means ideally half of our class has completed their [[Tasks/T-Shirt Shadow Prints#Reflection prompts\|final portfolio entry for the task]] by Monday October 2 at 10 PM, so that Mr. Gordon has time to create transparencies of your images so you can make your shirts the next day.
