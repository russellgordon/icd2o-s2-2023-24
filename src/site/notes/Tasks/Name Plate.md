# Name Plate
## Objective

Draw the letters of your name in block letters, using a hand-drawn plan to help get you started.
## What you'll need to begin

- [ ] The [[Setup/Installing Playgrounds\|Playgrounds app]] installed on your computer
- [ ] Another copy of the [[Setup/Subscribe to Turtle Sketches\|Sketches Template added to your list of playgrounds]], renamed to be titled *Name Plate*
- [ ] Your black, hardcover, graph paper notebook
## Success criteria

- [ ] a plan is made to consider at least some of the necessary turtle movements to draw your name (see exemplar below)
- [ ] your name is drawn in block, not bubble, letters, with consistent spacing
- [ ] code includes [[Style/Well Formatted Code#Use Comments to Describe Intent\|concise comments that describe intent]]
- [ ] code is [[Style/Well Formatted Code#Indent Code Consistently\|correctly indented]]
## Exemplar

Here is an example of a plan for drawing letters with consistent spacing:

Note how after a while, shorthand is used to describe turtle movements. This is a good strategy for making a useful plan without taking a lot of time.

> [!TIP]
> Before moving on to draw the next letter in your name, ensure that the turtle finishes drawing a letter in the same **position** and **heading** that it started in. You will see a little later on why this is a useful approach.
## Reflection prompts

1. How long did it take you to draw out a plan?
2. How often did you refer to your plan while coding?
3. How might a plan be useful for debugging a logical error?
